Billing Application with PySide2 and MySQL
A complete billing management system built using PySide2 for the GUI, MySQL for database management, and Pandas for exporting records to Excel. This application enables users to manage customer and billing records effectively with functionalities like adding, viewing, exporting, and deleting records.

Features
Add Bills: Save customer and bill details, including automatic capture of the current time.

View Records: Display all saved records (customers and bills) in a tabular format.

Export to Excel: Generate an Excel file of all records for offline use or analysis.

Delete Customers: Remove a customer and their associated bills from the database.

Intuitive GUI: User-friendly interface designed using PySide2.

Technology Stack
Frontend: PySide2 (Qt for Python)

Backend: MySQL

Data Export: Pandas

Programming Language: Python

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x: The application is written in Python, so you need to have it installed. Download it here.

MySQL: Install and set up MySQL on your system. Follow instructions here.

Pip: Ensure the Python package manager pip is installed.

Installation
Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/billing-app.git
cd billing-app
Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or, manually install the dependencies:

bash
pip install PySide2 pymysql pandas
Set Up the Database
Open MySQL Workbench or your MySQL terminal.

Create the database and tables:

sql
CREATE DATABASE BillingDB;

USE BillingDB;

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Bills (
    bill_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    amount FLOAT NOT NULL,
    bill_date DATE NOT NULL,
    time_slot TIME NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);
Update the database connection in get_connection() if your MySQL setup differs:

python
return pymysql.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_username",        # Replace with your MySQL username
    password="your_password",    # Replace with your MySQL password
    database="BillingDB"
)
Usage
Run the Application

bash
python billing_app.py
Features

Add customer and bill details via the form fields and click "Save Bill".

Click "Load Records" to fetch and display all saved records.

Export records to an Excel file by clicking "Export to Excel".

Delete a customer (and their associated bills) by entering their email and clicking "Delete Customer".

How It Works
Database Operations:

The app uses pymysql to connect to the MySQL database and perform operations like inserting, fetching, and deleting records.

Time is captured automatically for each bill using Python's datetime module.

GUI:

PySide2 is used to create an intuitive interface with buttons and fields for interacting with the database.

Excel Export:

Records are exported to an Excel file using Pandas, allowing users to analyze data offline.

Screenshots
Include screenshots of your application's interface if possible (e.g., saving a bill, viewing records, etc.).

Future Enhancements
Add search functionality to filter records dynamically.

Integrate a date range filter for querying records.

Include graphs and charts for analyzing billing trends.
